# SQL-Project-1
This project is based on Database of a music studio. Once you do this then database like Book studio, Library, Movie rental, etc. Will be familiar to you.

# SQL Database Project Practice

This project is based on a SQL database practice series by **Rishabh Mishra** on YouTube. The goal is to develop SQL skills through hands-on projects and complex queries.

## Overview
While following Rishabh Mishra's tutorials, I've gone beyond the basic examples, introducing my own enhancements and optimizations. These modifications include creating more complex queries and optimizing the database structure and query performance.

How I solve Question :
step 1 : Correctly understand the question what it needs.
step 2 : 

## Project Structure
- **Database Creation**: The database and tables are structured based on the video’s guidelines with additional indexing for improved query speed.
- **Custom Queries**: To expand upon the examples, I have written advanced SQL queries that address additional use cases and optimized solutions.

## Features
- **Enhanced Query Complexity**: I’ve added custom queries that build on the base project to solve more complex problems.
- **Optimized Solutions**: I've applied indexing and SQL optimizations to improve the efficiency of each query, particularly for large datasets.
- **Documentation**: Detailed comments are provided in the SQL code to explain each custom change and optimization.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Set up the database using the SQL schema provided.
3. Run the queries from the `queries.sql` file to explore both standard and optimized solutions.


Here’s a simplified version of Jose Portilla’s problem-solving steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read the question, define the inputs and outputs, and note any constraints.

2. **Plan the Solution**: Outline a step-by-step plan, breaking it into smaller parts or functions.

3. **Write a Basic Solution**: Start with a straightforward solution to confirm the logic, even if it’s not optimized.

4. **Optimize**: Refine the code for efficiency by reducing unnecessary steps and using appropriate data structures.

5. **Test with Examples**: Run sample inputs, including edge cases, to check for correctness.

6. **Review and Comment**: Add comments for clarity and do a final check for readability.

This approach keeps you organized and progressively improves the solution.
